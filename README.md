# Development-of-an-Intelligent-Assistant-for-Trading-Systems-Based-on-a-Recurrent-Neural-Network

Type of work: Bachelor thesis

Objective: The primary goal of the thesis was to develop an intelligent virtual assistant capable of forecasting stock market trends using recurrent neural networks in order to simulate realistic trading decisions based on predicted volume and price movements.

Key skills:

•	Data collection & Preprocessing (including normalization and dimensionality reduction)

•	Feature engineering

•	Design and implementation of neural networks architectures

•	Model training, evaluation and tuning

•	Analytical writing and structured presentation of technical results

Main results: 

•	A two-stage predictive model was developed for financial time series forecasting, where the first stage predicted trading volume and the second used that output, alongside technical indicators and past price data, to forecast stock prices (see the bottom-left figure).

•	The system was successful in identifying the overall direction of market movement, making it effective for trend-based trading strategies (see the bottom-right figure).

•	The developed system successfully demonstrated the integration of analytical forecasting methods with automated decision logic. This work lays the foundation for further development, such as improving model performance with more advanced architectures (e.g., LSTM or Transformer) and deploying the assistant as a full-featured tool for traders and analysts.
